# Introduction

Tailor can be extended with custom extensions for the purpose of handling various unique use cases that are not supported out of the box. There are three ways to extend Tailor:

* [custom content elements](./elements.md),
* [custom containers](./containers.md),
* [custom meta inputs](./metas.md).

They need to be located in their respective folders inside the extensions folder which is located in the root of the Tailor repository. How to create and configure each extension can be found on their specific pages.
